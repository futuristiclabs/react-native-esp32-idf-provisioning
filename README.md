## Sequence for ESP32 Provisioning (BLE)
This sequence diagram illustrates the provisioning process for an ESP32 device using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE):

### Participants:

1. **Mobile App**: The React Native application on the user's device(ios/android).
2. **ESP32 Device**: The ESP32 device in provisioning mode.
3. **Provisioning Service**: A service running on the ESP32 device responsible for handling the provisioning process.

#### Messages:
1. **Mobile App -> ESP32 Device (Broadcast)**:
Message: Service discovery request for provisioning service.
2. **ESP32 Device -> Mobile App (Response)**:
Message: Service information advertisement (including UUID for provisioning service).
3. **Mobile App -> ESP32 Device:**
Message: Connection request to provisioning service.
4. **ESP32 Device -> Mobile App**:
Message: Connection confirmation.
5. **Mobile App -> ESP32 Device**:
Message: Security handshake initiation (e.g., key exchange).
6. **ESP32 Device -> Mobile App**:
Message: Security handshake response (e.g., encrypted keys).
7. **Mobile App -> ESP32 Device**:
Message: Provisioning data (e.g., WiFi SSID, password, other settings).
8. **ESP32 Device -> Mobile App**:
Message: Provisioning confirmation or error message.
9. **Mobile App -> ESP32 Device (Optional)**:
Message: Disconnect request.
10. **ESP32 Device -> Mobile App (Optional)**:
Message: Disconnect confirmation.
